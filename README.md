# Risky-Occupations-using-Text-mining

Motive: The objective for this project is to identify the occupations that are risky. Our assumption for defining an occupation as risky is based on the number of deaths while performing a particular occupation. Based on the data provided if an occupation is associated with large number of deaths then that occupation is risky. By identifying the risky occupations, we would be able to include stringent safety measure in order to avoid accident leading to death/ injury.

Dataset:  osha.csv file containing ~16000 records to identify the occupations as well as whether an incident led to death or injury for each record.2166 records in the osha.csv dataset were manually labelled. 15 categories of occupations were identified: carpenter, construction worker, contractor, electrician, engineer, foreman, housekeeper, labourer, logger, machine operator, mechanic, painter, technician, truck driver, welder
